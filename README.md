# OpenCV Base Tutorial
The notebook OpenCV_BaseCommandsTutorial.ipynb wants to be a simple list of commands with examples for those who have never used the library before.

## Project Overview
The notebook will guide you through building filters, convolute those with images and visualizing the results.
At the end of the notebook, you will have chance to use the Canny Edge Detector together with Hough Lines to draw a rough boundary of a cat on a white background.

## Project Instructions

### Instructions

1. Clone the repository on your computer. For those who are not familiar with command line utilities, GitHub has developed this utility which lets do pretty much everything you need through a GUI.
   [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
2. Download the dataset (the link is included in the jupyter notebook).
3. Open a terminal window and navigate to the project folder. Open the notebook OpenCV_BaseCommandsTutorial.ipynb and follow the instructions.

__NOTE:__ Chances are part of the code may not run due to some missing packages. Please make sure to go through the notebook and retrieve all the necessary packages. The list of the packages can be found in requirements.txt.

## GitHub rendering Problems

Sometimes GitHub cannot render the jupyter notebook properly. In such a situation, go to the [nbviewer website](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and copy and paste the URL address of the notebook so as to render it on the browser.
